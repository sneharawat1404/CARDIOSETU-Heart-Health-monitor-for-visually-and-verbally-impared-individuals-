**Heart Disease Prediction Bot**

This project aims to develop a Heart Disease Prediction Bot using machine learning techniques. The bot is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients with an accuracy of 90%, thus assisting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.

**Features**

_Heart Disease Prediction_: 
The bot utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the probability of heart disease.

_High Accuracy_: 
With a prediction accuracy of 90%, the bot provides reliable assessments to aid medical professionals in decision-making.

_Time Efficiency_: 
By automating the prediction process, the bot reduces the workload of doctors and minimizes patient waiting times.

_User-Friendly Interface_: 
The bot is designed with a simple and intuitive interface, allowing healthcare professionals to easily input patient data and obtain predictions promptly.


**How It Works**
_Data Collection_:
Relevant patient data such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical indicators are collected.

_Data Preprocessing_: 
The collected data is preprocessed to remove noise, handle missing values, and normalize features.

_Model Training_: 
Machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks are trained on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships.

_Prediction_: 
When provided with patient data, the trained model predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on learned patterns.

_Output_: The bot provides the prediction outcome along with the probability score, assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.
