**Heart Disease Prediction Bot**
This project aims to develop a Heart Disease Prediction Bot using machine learning techniques. The bot is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients with an accuracy of 90%, thus assisting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and intervention.

**Features**
Heart Disease Prediction: The bot utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and predict the probability of heart disease.
High Accuracy: With a prediction accuracy of 90%, the bot provides reliable assessments to aid medical professionals in decision-making.
Time Efficiency: By automating the prediction process, the bot reduces the workload of doctors and minimizes patient waiting times.
User-Friendly Interface: The bot is designed with a simple and intuitive interface, allowing healthcare professionals to easily input patient data and obtain predictions promptly.
**How It Works**
Data Collection: Relevant patient data such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical indicators are collected.
Data Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to remove noise, handle missing values, and normalize features.
Model Training: Machine learning models such as logistic regression, decision trees, or neural networks are trained on the preprocessed data to learn patterns and relationships.
Prediction: When provided with patient data, the trained model predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on learned patterns.
Output: The bot provides the prediction outcome along with the probability score, assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.
